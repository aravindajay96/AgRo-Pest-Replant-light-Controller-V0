# 🌿 AgRo – Pest Repellent Light Controller Unit

## Simple Technology Solving a Common Farming Problem

Night-time pest attacks are a major challenge for many Sri Lankan farmers, especially in **brinjal and vegetable cultivation**. Excessive use of chemical pesticides not only increases cost but also harms the environment and human health.

To address this issue, the **AgRo – Pest Repellent Light Controller Unit** was designed as a **simple, affordable, and effective electronic solution** using basic embedded systems principles.

## 🚜 Project Overview

This device uses **controlled light-blinking patterns** during night-time to disrupt pest activity above farmland. The approach provides a **natural and eco-friendly alternative** to chemical pest control methods, supporting **organic and sustainable agriculture**.

This is not complex automation — it is **practical technology** designed specifically for real farming conditions in Sri Lanka.

## ⚙️ System Components

- **ESP32 Microcontroller**  
  Controls programmable timing and light-blinking patterns.

- **Solid State Relay (SSR)**  
  Safely switches AC lamps with high reliability and electrical isolation.

- **Power Supply Module**  
  Compact and stable power unit designed for outdoor agricultural environments.

---

## 🔄 Working Principle

- The ESP32 generates timed ON/OFF control signals.
- The SSR switches AC lamps according to the programmed blinking pattern.
- Blinking lights disturb night-time pest behavior, reducing crop damage.
- The system operates continuously with minimal maintenance.
