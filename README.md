# 🌿 AgRo – Pest Repellent Light Controller Unit

## Simple Technology Solving a Common Farming Problem

Night-time pest attacks are a major challenge for many Sri Lankan farmers, especially in **brinjal and vegetable cultivation**. Instead of relying heavily on chemical pesticides, this project presents a **simple, affordable, and effective electronic solution**.

The **AgRo Pest Repellent Light Controller Unit** uses controlled light-blinking patterns to disrupt pest activity above farmland, supporting **organic and sustainable agriculture**.

## 🔦 Field Deployment & Operational Test

The image below shows the Pest Repellent Light Controller Unit in actual operation, connected to an AC lamp and powered from the mains supply.
This setup demonstrates the system’s readiness for real farm environments, where it can be installed near crop fields and operated continuously during night-time hours.

- Highlights from this setup:
- Fully enclosed, weather-resistant control unit
- Safe AC lamp switching using Solid State Relay (SSR)
- Simple plug-and-play installation
- Suitable for outdoor and semi-outdoor agricultural use

## 🔄 Working Principle

1. ESP32 generates programmable ON/OFF timing signals  
2. SSR switches AC lamps according to the blinking pattern  
3. Blinking light disrupts pest movement and feeding behavior  
4. System runs continuously with minimal maintenance
